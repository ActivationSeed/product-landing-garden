          <h3>The Science of Whole Food</h3>
            <p>Your body was created to eat, process, and derive its nutrition from food—real, healthy food.  So, when we create our products, we start by looking at food. What is the “good stuff” in the highest quality food that we are missing in our diets? Which of those foods have the greatest potential to impact—and empower—extraordinary health?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="principle-block">
          <h3>Traceability</h3>
            <p>Traceability is key to what makes Garden of Life’s products so special. Traceability starts with knowing where each and every ingredient in our products comes from and getting to know each and every source. Our Garden of Life Organics line, is made with Organic fruit and herbs—every single product in this line is Certified USDA Organic and Non-GMO Verified by the Non-GMO Project. It’s so important to start with fruits and vegetables that are grown without harmful chemicals. We want to get the good stuff from foods that are grown without any of the bad stuff. We do it because it’s the only way we know to deliver on our promise of Empowering Extraordinary Health®.</p>

          <div class="principle-block">
          <h3>Clean is Healthy</h3>
            <p>We start with what goes IN our products—true, whole food ingredients. But we don’t stop there. We also pay very close attention to what we keep OUT of them. And once again, we look at food—real nutrition food. When was the last time you picked up an apple, turned to read the ingredients, and saw a list of chemicals? If it’s not in your food, then we don’t want it in our supplements. We use the following third-party (never self-affirmed) certifications to prove we are clean!</p>
